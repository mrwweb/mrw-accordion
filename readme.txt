An accessible accordion block that's a joy to edit

== Description ==

An accessible accordion block built by progressively enhancing semantic HTML. The only custom option is an icon color style (black or white) on the Accordion wrapper block.

== Changelog ==

= 0.2.0 =
* Single block version. This one should work!

= 0.1.0 =
* Failed first attempt due to [nested `templateLock` bug](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/11681#issuecomment-884532810). I learned something. Let's try this again!
