An accessible accordion block that's a joy to edit

== Description ==

An accessible accordion block built by progressively enhancing semantic HTML. The only custom option is an icon color style (black or white) on the Accordion wrapper block. The block uses a core Heading block for editing the accordion "title", so heading level and design is customizable.
